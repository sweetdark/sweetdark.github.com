##Getting a fast fix with the last known location

Maybe it is too long time for user to wait the accurate location, so i can utilize a cached location by calling getLastKnownLocamtion(String);

``` cpp
String locationProvider = LocationManager.NETWORK_PROVIDER;

Location lastKnownLocation = lcationManager.getLastKnownLocation(locationProvider);
```
In this way, we can get lastLocation immediately

##Adjusting the model to save battery and data exchange

Here are some things you might change to find a good balance between good location and performance

* Reduce the size of the window
* Set the location providers to return update less frequently
